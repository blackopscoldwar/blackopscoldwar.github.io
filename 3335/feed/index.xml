					<description><![CDATA[FINALLY anytown USA as a 6v6 map.

Deprogram looks nuts. Never thought we&#039;d see that  amazing mission as a multiplayer map. Feels like Micro on the scale of nuts.

Forsaken just keeps looking better and better. I hope it delivers. 

Whilst I&#039;m dissapointed we&#039;re only getting 2 6v6 maps, im honestly looking forward to this season, it looks like  a good way to cap off Cold War.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All things considered this looks like a pretty good send off for CW. There&#039;s been some fairly poor battle passes through the journey of this game but with a good mix of new maps, Forsaken looking superb and a fair few other bits I&#039;m very tempted to dive in.  


Would still love to see Nakatomi Plaza turned into a solid 6v6 map but I doubt that dream will ever come true. Just have to hope it survives in the next Warzone update...]]></description>
