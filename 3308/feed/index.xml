					<description><![CDATA[What the stacks also do is ruin the game for new players.

					<description><![CDATA[I get why people hate clans but c’mon guys, is it really bad for people to want to play with their friends at all?

And if that clan tag wasn’t there, but they were 4 skilled players anyways that played together because they were friends, would you not complain just because they don’t have something visually saying “hey we play together”?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t want to be rude, clan stacks can get frustrating but playing without friends in this game is just not fun. The average player is not reliable any more. Not every game has to be sweaty but when your teammates don&#039;t even try to play the objective, revive, supply etc then what is the point. 

Chances of getting into a decent squad, let alone a good squad are so low it hurts. Battlefield has always been a communication game, especially in the last decade. Now the average, casual player just doesn&#039;t bother. Even casual players back in the day would still communicate with randoms, its how you made friends. You can say you do these things, PTFO and all but if you play this game enough its simply not true. Games that go ticket for ticket are far and less between games that finish 500-0. &quot;Clans&quot; aren&#039;t going anywhere and with 128 players, a party of 8 won&#039;t even have as much as an impact.]]></description>
