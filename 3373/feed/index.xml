					<description><![CDATA[Nice! I‚Äôm going for level 1000 next season and will mostly play zombies, I just have a couple of questions if you would be so kind; what modes/map did you mostly play? Did you exfil at any certain level to maximize XP gains (since xp slows down the more rounds you go)? I‚Äôm trying to plan ahead how I‚Äôm gonna go about it and would really appreciate any advice! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="üòä" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can‚Äôt but laugh at the wording.

Playing for 6 hours a day every day for the last 60 days ‚Äúok brief intermission before playing non stop for another 2 months‚Äù

Hope that doesn‚Äôt come across the wrong way. But congrats. Personally my average level every season has been around 300-400. I get so bored and burnt out from this game. The zombie maps lack content and making the modes time limited doesn‚Äôt help!! 

Cough cranked still waiting on a return]]></description>
