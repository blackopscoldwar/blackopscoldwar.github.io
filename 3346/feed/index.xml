	Comments on: Why did they make this weapon so painfully useless? It only kills people if you land a direct hit, but at that point why not just use a sniper or shotgun for a One-Shot kill?	</title>

					<description><![CDATA[Because every time it&#039;s OP it ruins the gameflow. It&#039;s not fun to be oneshotted trough a wall where you cannot even see the enemy or the grenade. 

It should be a rare, optional choice, not an all around AOE instant killing machine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s supposed to be a fun secondary weapon it&#039;s not supposed to be OP. I have this in all my classes and as someone who likes rushing the objective, I like spamming this with my stuns and semtex. I think i have the highest KD ratio with this gun so its not useless at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you played the game at launch for the first few weeks when flak jacket actually didn’t work the game had a real explosive problem… (my china lake has a 4.5kd on it) it’s definitely better this way and not have it rule the game again]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[People forget the main thing that made the launchers in mw2 so annoying was that they had 1 man army to constantly refill ammo so after they got in a good spot they were impossible to stop. Simple solution make the thumper have a couple shots to start with and no way to refill but die. There’s a better way to balance things than by making them unusable especially in a game with 3-4 secondaries that can kill in one shot plus the option to take an extra primary over a secondary and even in the launcher category the thumper is the only one that can’t be useful against streaks therefore it should be supremely useful on people. There’s literally no reason to take a thumper over any other secondary except if you just wanna have fun/hate your life.]]></description>
