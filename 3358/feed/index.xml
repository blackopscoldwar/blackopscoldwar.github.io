					<description><![CDATA[XM4 in game isn&#039;t even a real gun. Flat top M4s weren&#039;t around in the 80s; there were some instances of Special forces cutting off the carry handle and replacing it with a pic rail, but it didn&#039;t look anything like the XM4 in game and retained the iron sights.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The issue is that a good portion of the weapons are from 90s+, in a game set in the 80s. It&#039;s not like WW1 and 2 shoots where they had to use prototype weapons that were never produced because of the limited options. There are plenty of guns that they could have used, just look at the original black ops.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ackshually, it’s the XM177E1, and it’s modeled with a civilian safety, flat-top rails weren’t adopted until the 1990s, and the designation “XM4” wasn’t used until 1984, and even then, they only applied it to the XM177E2,  so now my immersion is ruined &#062;:(

0/10, fix your game Treyarch
